# Credit Card Fraud Detection - EDA Project

## Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers. Fraudulent activities cause substantial losses and impact customer trust. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on credit card transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent behavior. 

## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from the credit card fraud detection dataset. The project focuses on:
- Understanding the dataset structure and data types.
- Identifying and visualizing patterns in fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
- Statistical analysis of numerical features like transaction amounts.
- Correlation analysis of numerical features to aid in feature selection for further modeling.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Features of the Analysis
- Bar charts for visualizing transaction counts (fraudulent vs. legitimate).
- Histograms for understanding the distribution of transaction amounts.
- Heatmaps for visualizing correlations among numerical features.
- Summary statistics including min, max, mean, and median of numerical columns.

## Results
The analysis revealed several key insights into fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Visualizations and statistical summaries are included in the attached notebook for detailed exploration.
